<h1>Why Haven't I Received My KeepKey Order Yet?</h1>
<div class="article-content">
          <div class="article-body"><p>There are a few reasons that you may not have received your order yet. We will notify you when your order ships, but if you are waiting, you may want to understand the reason for delay.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Delays</strong></h2>
<p>Occasionally, there are delays in shipments. Reasons this may happen are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A high influx of orders.&nbsp;</strong>Sometimes, if KeepKey has been featured in a promotion, we experience a large influx of orders. This can slow down the shipping process.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>A limited team.&nbsp;</strong>Our team is small, but we work hard! Because we are not a warehouse, we do not work every day of the week. This may delay your order.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Customs.&nbsp;</strong>KeepKey has no control over packages held by customs. If your KeepKey is stuck in customs, we understand your frustration, but there is, unfortunately, nothing that can be done. Once customs is finished with the package, you should receive your device.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Shipped Orders</strong></h2>
<p>You will receive an email once we have printed your shipping label and sent your order. If you have not received this, your order has not been shipped yet, or we do not have the correct email for you. Please be sure to use the correct email address when purchasing your KeepKey.</p>
<p>If you have been waiting on an order longer than expected, you are free to reach out to our&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://keepkey.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_self">Support Team</a></strong>&nbsp;for details.&nbsp;</p></div>
