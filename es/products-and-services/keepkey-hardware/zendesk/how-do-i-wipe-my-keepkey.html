          <div class="article-body"><h3>Forgot your PIN? Wiping your KeepKey allows you to set up a new one! Just be sure to have your 12 word recovery sentence <strong>before</strong> wiping the device as you will need this to restore the funds on your wallet.</h3>

<h3>Wiping the KeepKey will set your device back to factory settings. To do so, follow the steps below.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Have access to your 12 word recovery sentence. If you wipe the device and do not have your recovery sentence, the funds will be permanently lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>&nbsp;Download and open the KeepKey Updater App: <strong><a href="https://beta.shapeshift.com/updater-download#" target="_self">https://beta.shapeshift.com/updater-download#</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>note:&nbsp;</em>If you already have the app downloaded you will need to uninstall and reinstall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>While the app is open, hold down the button on your KeepKey and plug it in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>You will see this screen:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong>Click "Forgot Pin?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;</strong>Your device screen should now read <strong>"WIPE DEVICE - Do you want to erase your private keys and settings?"</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong>When you're ready, hold down the button on your KeepKey to wipe the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>You can also wipe the device from <strong><a href="https://beta.shapeshift.com/settings" target="_self">https://beta.shapeshift.com/settings.</a></strong></h4>
<h4>You will need to have your KeepKey connected in order to do it this way meaning you will need to know your PIN.</h4>
