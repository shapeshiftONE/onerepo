<h1>How Do I Re-Sync My KeepKey?</h1>
<div class="article-content">
          <div class="article-body"><p><span>Registering a KeepKey with the platform enables you to see real-time updates to your transaction history and balances, as well as receive funds, without connecting your KeepKey. Your KeepKey only needs to be paired to sign a transaction.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A green dot indicates that your KeepKey is connected. </span></p>
<p><span>To re-sync your KeepKey:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Plug in your KeepKey.</span></li>
<li><span>Click "Pair KeepKey".</span></li>
<li><span>Choose the KeepKey in the popup box.</span></li>
<li><span>Click "Connect".</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>If it is still not connecting, unplug and plug it in again.</span></p>
