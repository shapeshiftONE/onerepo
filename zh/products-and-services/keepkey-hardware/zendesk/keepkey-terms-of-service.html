Neither you, nor any other person or entity, will have the right to (i) receive any royalty or consideration of any kind for the use of the User Content pursuant to these Terms or (ii) inspect or approve the editorial copy or other material that may be used in connection with the User Content. KeepKey will be free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained in such User Content for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to developing, manufacturing and marketing products that incorporate or otherwise rely upon such information.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Service may contain links to third-party materials that are not owned or controlled by KeepKey. KeepKey does not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services.

We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of these Terms, or KeepKey may suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to any or all of the Services if: (i) we are so required by a facially valid subpoena, court order, or binding order of a government authority; (ii) we reasonably suspect you of using the Service in connection with a Prohibited Activity; (iii) use of your account is subject to any pending litigation, investigation, or government proceeding and/or we perceive a heightened risk of legal or regulatory non-compliance associated with your account activity; (iv) our service partners are unable to support your use; (v) you take any action that KeepKey deems as circumventing KeepKey�s controls, including, but not limited to, abusing promotions which KeepKey may offer from time to time; (vi) suspend or terminate your access to the Service for no reason.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If KeepKey suspends or terminates your use of the Service, in whole or in part, for any reason, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of our actions unless a court order or other legal process prohibits KeepKey from providing you with such notice. You acknowledge that KeepKey�s decision to take certain actions, including limiting access to, suspending, or closing your account, may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to KeepKey�s risk management and security protocols.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Indemnity</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless KeepKey and its subsidiaries, agents, licensors, managers, and other affiliated companies, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney�s fees) arising from: (a) your use of and access to the Service, including any data or content transmitted or received by you; (b) your violation of any term of these Terms, including without limitation your breach of any of the representations and warranties above; (c) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of privacy or Intellectual Property Rights; (d) your violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation; (e) User Content or any content that is submitted via your account including without limitation misleading, false, or inaccurate information; (f) your willful misconduct; or (g) any other party�s access and use of the Service with your unique username, password or other appropriate security code.</p>

<ol start="10">
<li>No Warranty</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Service is provided on an �as is� and �as available� basis. Use of the Service is at your own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from KeepKey or through the Service will create any warranty not expressly stated herein. Without limiting the foregoing, KeepKey, its subsidiaries, its affiliates, and its licensors do not warrant that the content is accurate, reliable or correct; that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. Any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Service is downloaded at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or mobile device or loss of data that results from such download or your use of the Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KeepKey does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or service advertised or offered by a third party through the Service or any hyperlinked website or service, and KeepKey will not be a party to or in any way monitor any transaction between you and third-party providers of products or services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Federal law, some states, provinces and other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties, so the above exclusions may not apply to you. This agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers and exclusions under this agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Limitation of Liability</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall KeepKey, its affiliates, agents, directors, employees, suppliers or licensors be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, this service. Under no circumstances will KeepKey be responsible for any damage, loss or injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other unauthorized access or use of the Service or your account or the information contained therein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, KeepKey assumes no liability or responsibility for any (a) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content; (b) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of our service; (c) any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal information stored therein; (d) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service; (e) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through our service by any third party; (f) any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Service; and/or (g) User Content or the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party. In no event shall KeepKey, its affiliates, agents, directors, employees, suppliers, or licensors be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or costs in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to KeepKey hereunder or one hundred U.S. dollars (USD $100.00), whichever is greater.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if KeepKey has been advised of the possibility of such damage. The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. This agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state or jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under this agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Governing Law, Arbitration</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Governing Law.</strong>&nbsp;These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its conflict of laws principles, except to the extent Delaware state law is preempted by federal law. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of these Terms shall be governed by the applicable rules of arbitration in the State of Delaware. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Delaware for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that the State of Delaware is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Arbitration.</strong>&nbsp;Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from KeepKey. For any dispute with KeepKey, you agree to first contact us at&nbsp;<a href="https://keepkey.zendesk.com/hc/en-us">https://keepkey.zendesk.com/hc/en-us</a>&nbsp;and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that KeepKey has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, �Claims�), by binding arbitration in accordance with the applicable rules of arbitration in the State of Delaware. The arbitration will be conducted in Delaware, in English, unless you and KeepKey agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any arbitration fees, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with applicable arbitration rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys� fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) the arbitration organization may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from such arbitration organization; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney�s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing KeepKey from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>General</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong>Assignment.</strong>&nbsp;These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by KeepKey without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Notification Procedures and Changes to these Terms.</strong>&nbsp;KeepKey may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by KeepKey in our sole discretion. KeepKey reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in these Terms. KeepKey is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. KeepKey may, in its sole discretion, modify or update these Terms from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change these Terms in a material manner, we will update the �last modified� date at the bottom of this page and notify you that material changes have been made to these Terms. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Entire Agreement/Severability.</strong>&nbsp;These Terms, together with any additional terms, amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with KeepKey in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and KeepKey concerning the Service. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.</li>
