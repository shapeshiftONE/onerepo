**From** an outsider’s view, trading can seem complex, nuanced, and intangible. But like any subject, the best way to wrap your head around it is to learn from the experts. If you’re a book nerd, you’re in the right place. Below are seven recommended reads from [ShapeShift’s](http://shapeshift.com/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=fox_launch&utm_term=cta19) very own trading team.<br/>
