The crypto world is stock full of some of the brightest minds in tech and economics, and being a part of this community, one of the best things you can do for yourself is to hear what they have to say.

Staying up to date can be difficult — so we made it easy for you. Take a listen to the best crypto content around.

## The London Real Interviews Andreas Antonopoulos

This is a quick, 15-minute classic Andreas talk. He discusses interactions with people entering the space, bitcoins past bubbles, and the way that the industry has continued to develop.<br/>

## Crypto Beadles Interviews Erik Voorhees

*Yes, we’re more than a little biased*, but we’re being honest when we say that we think [Crypto Beadles](https://cryptobeadles.com/) and our Founder and CEO, [Erik Voorhees](https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees), produced one of the best interviews of the year. It’s a 40+ minute interview, and Robert Beadles puts in the work to keep the content fresh and interesting, diving into subjects like aliens (yes, really), time travel, and the early days of crypto.<br/>

## Pomp Takes on Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary

When we watched this segment on CNBC, we were blown away by [Anthony Pompliano’s](https://twitter.com/APompliano) ability to stay calm and collected, while offering clear and concise arguments for Bitcoin’s worth. This segment is short, sweet, and worth a listen.<br/>

## Caitlin Long Talks Libra with Peter McCormack

[Peter McCormack](https://twitter.com/PeterMcCormack) and [Caitlin Long](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_) discuss Facebook’s new cryptocurrency, Libra. Long spent over 20 years working on Wall Street, before becoming one of the founders of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition. She helped Wyoming enact 13 blockchain-enabling laws in 2018 and 2019, and is a powerhouse in the crypto space.<br/>

## Andreas Antonopoulos **Analyzes Libra**

Yes, another talk on Libra. Why? Facebook’s announcement is one of the biggest milestones so far in crypto, and [Andreas](https://twitter.com/aantonop) is one of the most well-respected names in the space. Listen in to hear what he has to say about Libra.<br/>

## **CZ Breaks Down the Binance Hack**

CZ’s AMA after the [Binance](https://www.binance.com/) hack deserves a place on this list. After working nonstop for 30 hours without sleep, he took the time to sit down and speak to Binance’s users. He breaks down the hack and theft of over 7,000 bitcoins from Binance, and discusses what the company is doing to ramp up security.<br/>

## Laura Shin Interviews Winklevoss Twins

The Winklevoss twins and [Laura Shin](https://twitter.com/laurashin) created a powerful Unchained episode in early 2019. They discussed the twins’ crypto exchange, [Gemini](https://gemini.com/); their stablecoin, [GUSD](https://coincap.io/assets/gemini-dollar); and plenty of interesting stories that make for a memorable episode.<br/>
