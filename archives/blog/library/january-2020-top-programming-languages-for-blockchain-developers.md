**The** blockchain space is full of people and businesses seeking to bring new ideas into reality, as well as build upon current ones. Maybe you’re looking into blockchain tech for the first time and want to create a prototype, or you’re still in the initial stages of research. Discovering what language to use in your process is essential to finding the best way to build your tech.

We’ve provided a list of some of the most popular programming languages for blockchain development, getting you up to speed on the basics of developing in this space.<br/> 

## C++

C++ is a powerful programming language and was the original language upon which Bitcoin was built. It’s object-orientated, allowing it to methodically bind pieces of data and making it an appropriate language for the creation of blockchains. C++ helps developers manage resources, have better memory control, and process interactions quickly. One way you can see this is in the many connections that take place between users and miners, transaction verification, and building blocks.

## [ Python](https://www.python.org/)

Python was created to be a simple, easy to use programming language. As such, it became one of the top programming languages in the world. The ease of Python allows developers to quickly build and test out new ideas, and its open-source support brings with it a host of tools that can help developers problem solve as they run into issues.

## [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/)

Solidity was built to write Ethereum-based smart contracts. It was primarily designed by the Ethereum team, allowing developers to write high-level, smart contract oriented code that could then be translated and usable into lower-level programming languages. Solidity is meant to increase the usability and technology behind blockchains, and although it’s new, it’s continuing to grow in popularity among the developer community.

## [Java](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml)

Java is a hugely popular coding language in the blockchain community, due to its object-oriented systems — an approach that is also found in C++. Its main appeal for blockchain developers comes from its portability. Through Java Virtual Machine, Java isn’t limited by device architecture and is known for its ability to handle large numbers of users on a blockchain network at the same time.

## [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

Another language that is growing in popularity across the blockchain space is Go. Developed in 2007, Go is a programming language created by developers at Google. In the blockchain world, it’s used primarily to build decentralized systems. It’s known for its ease-of-use and scalability, helping solve issues through its simplicity.

These are just a few of the languages used in the building of blockchains; creating new technologies and allowing for greater accessibility to the cryptocurrency space.<br/>
