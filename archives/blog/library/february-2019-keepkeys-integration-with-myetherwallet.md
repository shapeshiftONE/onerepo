We’re thrilled to announce KeepKey’s partnership with[**MyEtherWallet (MEWV5)**](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)**.**

The new integration with [**MyEtherWallet**](https://medium.com/@myetherwallet)means that interacting with the Ethereum blockchain is now easier than ever. Your KeepKey ensures that your keys are kept offline and safe while MEW provides an [**all-new, redesigned,**](https://medium.com/myetherwallet/lets-make-it-official-mew-v5-myetherwallet-s-all-new-interface-is-here-2063117180a4)simple, clean interface.

Sign transactions with your KeepKey while using MEW’s interface to send, receive and view your ETH tokens (including those not yet supported by KeepKey).

Our partnership with MEW also allows you to migrate any ERC-20 tokens that launch to the mainnet. This means if you hold ERC-20 tokens that are scheduled to fork, you’ll be able to use MEW to migrate your tokens while keeping them safe with your KeepKey. Check with your ERC-20 mainnet website for specific migration details.<br/> 

## Why Should I use a Hardware Wallet with MEW?

MEW puts you in charge of keeping your private keys safe from phishing sites, hackers, keyloggers, malware, and more. While being responsible for your private keys is critical, it can be burdensome to maintain the necessary security practices to keep them safe.

**Using a hardware wallet like KeepKey in tandem with MEW to store your keys offline lets you rest easy that your keys are safe.**

## Integrate KeepKey into web apps using our open JavaScript Library

 <br/>We also have some exciting news for our developer community. Thanks to our new open JavaScript library, web apps can easily integrate KeepKey into their own products. Now, you can interact with KeepKey over WebUSB on Chrome.<br/><br/>This helped make KeepKey’s integration with MEW seamless and will be an excellent resource for anyone that would like to connect a hardware wallet to their product or service.<br/>
