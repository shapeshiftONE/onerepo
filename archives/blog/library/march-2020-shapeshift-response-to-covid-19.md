# ShapeShift Response to COVID-19

**Due** to the ongoing threat of the coronavirus known as COVID-19, the [ShapeShift](http://shapeshift.com/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=shapeshift_platform&utm_term=cta_31) team has decided to close our office and move to a remote work structure until further notice. COVID-19 has shown that it has the ability to spread rapidly through populations, and ShapeShift wants to do all that it can to hinder this virus in the coming weeks and months.

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html) and many others have highlighted the need to “flatten the curve” of the virus. If stringent measures aren’t taken to halt its spread, we could see the healthcare system being overwhelmed by more cases than it can readily handle. If we take the proper precautions, we can keep the number of cases below that threshold. If this is done successfully, then the healthcare system will likely have adequate resources to take care of those who tested positive throughout the span of the outbreak.<br/>

## **Our Thought Process**

ShapeShift has been monitoring the situation closely in the Colorado area, as many of our team members are located in and around Denver. This past Tuesday, March 10, we saw Colorado declare a state of emergency as the number of coronavirus cases in the area continued to rise. As of the time that this post is published, the state has not yet been adequately supplied with coronavirus testing kits.

“As the state’s leading cryptocurrency company, we need to be ahead of the curve and lead by example,” says ShapeShift’s Founder and CEO, Erik Voorhees. “Hopefully, if others follow suit we can keep the number of COVID-19 cases below the healthcare system’s capacity throughout this outbreak.”

Our decision to implement this policy is an effort to be proactive, rather than reactive, as we continue to monitor the situation in Colorado and abroad. The safety and well-being of our employees and their families comes first, and will continue to be front of mind in any further actions that we take regarding COVID-19.

## **Looking Forward**

[ShapeShift](http://shapeshift.com/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=shapeshift_platform&utm_term=cta_31) continues to build its zero-commission self-custody trading platform for those who value financial sovereignty. Yet again, the status quo financial system is showing worrying cracks, and we believe open, borderless alternatives will help the world recover and thrive. This outbreak has only strengthened our resolve.
