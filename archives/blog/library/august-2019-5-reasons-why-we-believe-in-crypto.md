## *<br/>Do you think that cryptocurrency is changing the world?*

We do. With all of the skeptics out there, it’s easy to lose focus on what really matters: the impact we are making on the world by building in this industry.

If you feel like you have started to become a victim of [**FUD**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt)**,** we want to remind you why we are here. **To create a borderless financial system built on open, decentralized protocols.**

If you need a reason to believe, look no further. Get inspired by the five reasons we at [ShapeShift](http://shapeshift.com/) believe in crypto.

## **#1 The Principles**

Cryptocurrencies were not just born out of economic necessity. Ideologies and philosophies have deep roots in this space. Many early adopters have recognized that on a fundamental level, we were in need of a freer and smarter form of money. Bitcoin was recognized as a tool that could be a borderless currency, create cheaper transactions and advance ease of use in exchanging value.<br/><br/>Read a note from ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees >> Building a Bridge to Financial Sovereignty <br/> 

## **#2 The Community**

If you’ve spent any time on crypto Reddit or Twitter, or at meetups and events, you know what we mean. Yes, this community can be divided, but it’s also filled with some of the brightest minds in tech and economics. The crypto world is filled with intelligent, quirky, humorous, and passionate individuals who’ve created a culture unlike anything the world has ever seen.<br/> 

## **#3 The Hope for a Better World**

Crypto and blockchain tech have the potential to advance more than just the world of finance. Everything from healthcare and real estate, to video and education, are within its reach. Check out [Inc.com’s article](https://www.inc.com/john-white/9-industries-that-will-soon-be-disrupted-by-blockchain.html) on industries that may be disrupted by crypto. Our favorite is #9.<br/> 

## **#4 The Resilience**

Crypto has faced a lot of backlash over the years. It has fought to shake off a bad reputation and struggled to help the world understand the positive nature that such an economic phenomenon can be. Again and again, its shown that it’s here to stay, and personally, we can’t wait to see where it goes.<br/> 

## **#5 The Potential**

Although people claim to, nobody really knows where the crypto space will take us. Our favorite point made at [Berlin Blockchain Week](https://www.blockchainweek.berlin/) speaks volumes on this point.

*We need to make sure that we aren’t just building to extend our runway and gamble on the future of what we’re doing. —* [***Vitalik Buterin***](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin)

We need to build long-lasting, effective technology that makes clear to the world in a very simple way, how remarkable these advancements are.
