It is a known fact that there are not enough women working in the tech industry. However, there are women out there shaping technology, and creating amazing products. These women typically get asked “what does it feel to be a woman in tech?” or get invited to give the diversity talk instead of being asked about what they work on.

[In this podcast](https://thewomenintechshow.com/), Edaena Salinas, a software engineer, interviews powerful women working in tech, digging into their work, lives, and impact on the world. If you’re looking for women in tech podcast featuring technical interviews, this is it.
