## Ready for a portfolio management tool worthy of your Trezor?

[**Trezor©**](https://trezor.io/) hardware wallets are compatible with the [ShapeShift Platform](http://shapeshift.com/), an enhanced interface to manage and interact with your crypto. Send, receive, trade, buy, track, and hodl your crypto in a beautiful web interface. All while your private keys are secured offline by your Trezor.

## Why Use a New Interface for Trezor?

It was high time for cold storage to become more convenient. The new ShapeShift Platform solves this problem. We offer a superior user experience and interface that gives you complete control over your private keys.

We’re bringing the most advanced and necessary crypto management tools together in one, simple, clean and secure platform — all compatible with your Trezor.<br/> 

## Trezor + ShapeShift = Better Together

We truly believe that when a Trezor is connected to the platform, users are provided with an upgraded experience like never before. Compare the features in the new ShapeShift Platform to features available in the native Trezor wallet.
