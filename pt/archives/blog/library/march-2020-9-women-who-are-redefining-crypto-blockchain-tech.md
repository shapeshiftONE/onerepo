**<br/>In** the traditional worlds of STEM and finance, women can find glass ceilings, male-dominated social structures, frustrating inequalities in salary, opportunity, and subtle prejudice. Women fight an uphill battle in these industries in order to reach leadership positions.

While these frustrating misconceptions are undoubtedly alive in the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology sector, women like ShapeShift’s COO Lisa Loud, see crypto as an environment that is ripe with opportunity for women. Crypto is still a nascent industry, and she sees a space for women to establish themselves in its vanguard.

Women have long been among the [movers and shakers of the crypto space,](https://www.glamour.com/story/meet-the-women-of-cryptocurrency) and are filling more and more leading roles as the industry continues to gain steam. Below are just a few of the women who are transforming the face of crypto and driving it forward to bring about mass adoption.

* Elizabeth Stark
* Meltem Demirors
* Lisa Loud
* Elena Sinelnikova
* Naomi Brockwell
* Rachael Horwitz
* Laura Shin
* Catherine Coley
* Caitlin Long<br/>
