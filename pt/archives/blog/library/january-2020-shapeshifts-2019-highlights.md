**<br/>In** the new year, itâ€™s always a good practice to reflect on the previous yearâ€™s accomplishments. Looking back at 2019, we realize that it has been a monumental year for [ShapeShift](http://shapeshift.com/). As the world of cryptocurrency continues to evolve, so have our products and services. Weâ€™ve launched our [new platform](http://beta.shapeshift.com/), added [popular wallet](https://medium.com/shapeshift-stories/push-the-limits-of-your-ledger-89d442bd23cb) options, and announced [zero commission trading](https://shapeshift.com/free-trading) for our users. Weâ€™re working to bridge the divide between traditional and alternative finance, making the latest financial technology readily available to the world.

This has been a year of new challenges and big wins for us, with more on the horizon. Revisit 2019 with us and learn about some of ShapeShiftâ€™s defining moments this year.

## ShapeShift Beta Announced at ETHDenver

In late February, we unveiled the beta of our new crypto trading platform. The ShapeShift Platform (secured by our hardware wallet [KeepKey](https://shapeshift.io/keepkey/)) gave users access to an all-in-one cryptocurrency ecosystem. For the first time, hardware security worked with a crypto toolkit, coupled with a beautiful interface.

Big thanks to [ETHDenver](https://medium.com/u/79079ae79889?source=post_page-----aec29f48130a----------------------) for allowing us to introduce our new project at the event and demo the platform for the crypto community.

## The ShapeShift Platform Launched

On July 8th, we officially launched the ShapeShift Platform. Our new platform was only compatible with hardware security. Protected by [KeepKey](https://pages.shapeshift.com/keepkey/) and [Trezor](https://pages.shapeshift.com/get-started-trezor/) hardware wallets â€” your private keys remain entirely offline and **in your control**. Buying, selling, and hodling cryptocurrency had become easier than ever.

## ShapeShiftâ€™s Five-Year Anniversary

In July we celebrated a big milestone â€” ShapeShiftâ€™s five year anniversary. Weâ€™ve seen plenty of ups and downs in the crypto space, and we have to say, we love being a part of it. Our COO, Jon, [gave a speech to our team](https://medium.com/shapeshift-stories/the-story-of-shapeshift-d9c05cd88fea), we celebrated our successes and geared up for the work ahead.<br/> 

*ðŸ“¸ Head to our Instagram highlight for a* [*behind the scenes look at our anniversary party*](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE4MDcxMDAwNDc5MDk5NDI2?igshid=1g1gthu3deucg&story_media_id=2099071459111701569)*.*

##  Wallet Additions

Throughout the year, we added multiple wallets, giving [KeepKey](https://pages.shapeshift.com/keepkey/), [Trezor](https://pages.shapeshift.com/get-started-trezor/), and [Ledger](https://pages.shapeshift.com/ledger/) hardware wallet users access to our platform. With the addition of [Portis](https://pages.shapeshift.com/portis_wallet/) software wallet, users can now create a wallet in seconds, giving them an easy onboarding experience like never before.<br/>

## Whatâ€™s Next in 2020?

Weâ€™re growing, and continuing to enhance our products as we move ahead. As we step into 2020, weâ€™re ready for this year to be even bigger than the last. We may not know whatâ€™s next for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but weâ€™re going to stick around and find out.<br/>
