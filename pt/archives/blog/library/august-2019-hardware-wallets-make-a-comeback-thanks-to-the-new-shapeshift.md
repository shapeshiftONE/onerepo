# Hardware Wallets Make a Comeback Thanks to the New ShapeShift

**If** you’ve never heard of a crypto hardware wallet or simply think they‘ve lost their edge, it’s time to wise up. While the ease of custodial exchanges and wallets has lessened the popularity of cold storage, the hardware wallet user experience is constantly evolving.

The saying “[**not your keys, not your crypto**](https://medium.com/shapeshift-stories/why-we-support-proofofkeys-and-you-should-too-7147fbe46c27)”, is a perpetual reminder that the hardware wallet is still king when it comes to securing your private keys.<br/> 

## What is a hardware wallet?

A **hardware wallet** is a physical device that holds your crypto private keys offline, eliminating the risk of malware, keyloggers, computer viruses, or other risks that software wallets and exchanges are vulnerable to. Keeping your private keys offline through cold storage is the most secure way to manage your crypto. However, cold storage is not as user-friendly due to set-up and some feature limitations.

## A Better Hardware Experience

The new [ShapeShift](http://shapeshift.com/) was built around the idea of evolving the hardware wallet user experience. The platform provides an easy-to-use web interface for you to conveniently manage your crypto, while your private keys remain offline on your hardware wallet. Our platform currently supports two of the top-ranking hardware wallets: [**KeepKey**](https://shapeshift.io/keepkey/)**,** [**Ledger**](https://www.ledger.com/)**, and** [**Trezor**](https://trezor.io/).

## Why use a hardware wallet with the ShapeShift Platform?

We’re committed to empowering the world to securely take back control of their wealth. That’s why we built our platform around the most secure type of wallet — hardware. We’ll continue adding new compatible wallets for the ShapeShift Platform, but our first iteration is intended to solve a current problem in the ecosystem by bringing convenience to cold storage.

## Which hardware option is best for me?

 KeepKey, Ledger, and Trezor provide an excellent user experience when paired with the ShapeShift Platform, though there are some differences between the devices.

## KeepKey

[**KeepKey**](https://shapeshift.io/keepkey/)(a product of ShapeShift) is the premier wallet for the new ShapeShift. The platform serves as KeepKey’s new client, so it provides an optimal intuitive experience. With a beautiful sleek design, KeepKey has established a reputation as a high-quality wallet. The large screen and sturdy materials are for more than looking good — they also protect users from Man in the Middle attacks. Click [**here**](https://keepkey.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003047479) to see the digital assets supported on KeepKey.

## Trezor

[**Trezor**](https://trezor.io/start/) was the first hardware wallet on the market and is still a favorite amongst crypto OGs. Both models of Trezor are smaller than KeepKey and similar in size to a flash drive. Trezor also has more [supported coins](https://trezor.io/coins/) through their integrations with third parties, such as [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/) and [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home).

## Ledger

[Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) has helped bring advanced hardware security to the crypto masses and was one of the most requested wallets by our users. Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X owners can use the platform without an account, users can still track, send, receive, and secure their crypto for free.
