**From** an outsider’s view, trading can seem complex, nuanced, and intangible. But like any subject, the best way to wrap your head around it is to learn from the experts. If you’re a book nerd, you’re in the right place. Below are seven recommended reads from [ShapeShift’s](http://shapeshift.com/) very own trading team.<br/> 

## [Liar’s Poker by Michael Lewis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7865083-liar-s-poker)

*Liar’s Poker* is a semi-autobiographical book written by Michael Lewis. Lewis describes his life from his days at Princeton and the London School of Economics, to his experiences on Wall Street in the 1980s. He describes rising through the ranks at [Salomon Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/salomon-brothers.asp), making millions, and thriving in the competitive, cut-throat culture of Wall Street.<br/> 

## [When Genius Failed by Roger Lowenstein](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10669.When_Genius_Failed)

*When Genius Failed* is an account of the rise and fall of a hedge fund called [Long-Term Capital Management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermcapital.asp). Roger Lowenstein interviews key players in the failed hedge fund, painting a picture of the fund's early success and its subsequent downfall. Lowenstein gives readers an in-depth look into the world of international investing, and bond and equities trading.<br/> 

## [Fortune’s Formula by William Poundstone](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186124.Fortune_s_Formula)

“In 1956 two Bell Labs scientists discovered the scientific formula for getting rich.” So begins Goodreads description of how Claude Shannon and Edward Thorp used information theory to manage uncertainty in trading, gambling, and more. Shannon went on to become an investor with a highly successful rate of return to rival the likes of Warren Buffet.<br/> 

## [Barbarians at the Gate by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/781182.Barbarians_at_the_Gate)

The book is rife with the familiar notions of greed, opulence, and ambition, and is known to be highly recommended for traders.<br/> 

## [Market Wizards by Jack D. Schwager](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/966769.Market_Wizards)

*Market Wizards* gives us a dose of what we all need; lessons from the best in the industry.

## [Reminiscence of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefèvre](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100779.Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator)

*Reminiscence of a Stock Operator* was written way back in 1923, but its lessons are timeless. The book follows a market speculator named Larry Livingstone, revealing his advice on trading and the cycles and characteristics of the markets. In Lefèvre’s book, you’ll learn how to apply Livingstone’s trading principles.

## [Ugly Americans — Ben Mezerich](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86161.Ugly_Americans)

*Ugly Americans* is the story of John Malcolm, the man who may have made the largest deal in the history of the financial markets.
