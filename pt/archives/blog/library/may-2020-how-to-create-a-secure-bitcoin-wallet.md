If you’re looking for an easy, intuitive way to get started in crypto, or your current crypto service is lacking, it’s time to begin your journey in the [ShapeShift Platform](http://beta.shapeshift.com/). By reading this article you'll learn to set up a noncustodial cryptocurrency wallet, how to purchase bitcoin, and can begin to trade (without commissions) between dozens of digital assets.

## Create Your Wallet

Before you can own crypto, you need a wallet to store it safely. Setting up a software wallet is free, simple, and takes a matter of seconds. Follow the steps below to create your wallet now.

1. Visit the [ShapeShift Platform](http://beta.shapeshift.com/).<br/>
2. Select the software wallet option, Portis Wallet.<br/>
3. Click "Continue" on the popup modal.<br/>
4. Enter your email address and password.<br/>
5. Write down your password in a secure location.<br/>*Your password cannot be reset. If you lose it, your funds will be lost.<br/>*

## Easily Buy Crypto

Now that you've created a wallet, it's time to fund it by adding crypto. There are several ways to buy crypto using different exchanges, services, or marketplaces. More often than not, you will need to verify your account, and it can take several business days to receive your crypto. If you're looking for an instant solution, you can use a debit card in the same way that you buy most things online. This method allows you to receive your crypto almost instantly and is available in 20+ countries in the ShapeShift Platform. Our "buy crypto with debit card" feature has competitive rates, making it affordable and straightforward to use. 

**Buy BTC, ETH, and USDC with a debit card by following these steps:** 

1. Connect your new software wallet to the [ShapeShift Platform](http://beta.shapeshift.com/) or connect hardware wallet. <br/>
2. Click "Buy Crypto" at the top of your dashboard — no verification needed.<br/>
3. Choose "United States" or "International."<br/>
4. Click "Use Debit Card" and choose what cryptocurrency you want to buy.<br/>
5. Enter your debit card information.<br/>
6. Confirm your purchase and your crypto will be deposited within seconds.<br/>

## Track Your Cryptocurrencies

Just like any asset, crypto's value can fluctuate, and you'll want to track your gains and losses easily. Visualize portfolio performance through your dashboard, sparklines, and real-time price movements — anytime, anywhere. [ShapeShift](http://shapeshift.com/) leverages the powerful [CoinCap.io](https://coincap.io/) API to deliver accurate, up-to-the-second market data and historical charting. Rather than have to check crypto prices on another site, you can effortlessly switch between viewing your portfolio holdings and watching cryptocurrency price changes.<br/> 

## Convert to USDC

Are the highs and lows of crypto prices getting to you? Now, you can use our Convert Button to quickly exchange any of your assets into the stablecoin, [USDC](https://coincap.io/assets/usd-coi), with the click of a button. A stablecoin is typically pegged to a stable asset, such as USD, allowing holders to hedge against market volatility. Learn more about stablecoins in our blog [Stablecoins: Hedging Against Market Volatility.](https://shapeshift.com/library/stablecoins-hedging-against-market-volatility)
