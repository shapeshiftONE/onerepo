# An Open Letter to KeepKey Users

**As a KeepKey user, we want to thank you for taking crypto security seriously.**

The industry is building a new way for finance to work: borderless, decentralized, and built on open-source protocols.

And yet, with new territory comes new dangers.

When it comes to crypto, too often people buy some to make a quick buck — without learning about responsible use of these powerful tools. Sometimes they get hacked, or leave valuable assets with a risky third-party custodian.

**But not you.**

You acquired a hardware wallet because you take this seriously.

You know that the profound power of crypto comes with personal responsibility.

**We thank you for setting a good example.**

In 2017, ShapeShift acquired [KeepKey](https://shapeshift.io/keepkey/) to prepare for its next evolution. Since then, some wonder why the KeepKey client hasn’t changed or improved.

*Have we forgotten about this beautiful piece of hardware; this bedrock of self-custody in crypto assets?*

**We have not.**

For over a year, we’ve been building the New ShapeShift: a holistic platform for self-sovereign finance.

It’s built on a principle that we call “keys-out,” in which your private keys are secured on hardware, and yet you’re able to interact with the new digital financial frontier in an easy way.

**What makes the New ShapeShift unique?**

• It’s more *convenient* than cold storage.<br/>• It’s more *secure* than a custodial wallet or exchange.<br/>• It’s more *beautiful* — and more *ethical* — than a bank.

With [KeepKey,](https://shapeshift.io/keepkey/) you have everything you need to experience this new crypto platform. It’s our way of pushing the state of the art in crypto UX forward while staying true to the self-sovereign non-custodial model we’ve always pursued.

> “It’s built on a principle that we call “keys-out,” in which your private keys are secured on hardware, and yet you’re able to interact with the new digital financial frontier in an easy way.”

**Thank you for pioneering the new world of crypto finance with us.**

The New ShapeShift — a platform powered and secured by KeepKey.

**In liberty,**

Erik Voorhees<br/>*CEO, ShapeShift*
