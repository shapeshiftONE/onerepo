## **The 5 Best Bitcoin Documentaries**

There’s nothing quite like a good documentary. A film that’s so good it’s almost surreal. As a climbing enthusiast, I got hooked on documentaries like [Meru](http://www.merufilm.com/), [Free Solo](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/films/free-solo/), and [The Dawn Wall](https://www.dawnwall-film.com/). These are stories of humans, just like us, achieving superhuman feats of courage, strength, and will.

A good documentary blends the real and the surreal, inspiring us to look within ourselves and ponder the reality of our own limitations. Cryptocurrency is a unique story that fits into this strange, borderless realm of human potential. To this day, its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto is anonymous. Its philosophy is revolutionary, and the cutting edge technology seems to bring the future into reality.

Crypto is radically different from traditional banking and monetary systems in that it’s decentralized, giving power directly to traders themselves. Because of its limitless potential and growth opportunities, more and more people are coming around to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.

*But to give you a lay of the land, here are some of the best Bitcoin documentaries that provide a snapshot into the technology changing the world.*

## **<br/>Bitcoin — Shape The Future**

If you’re interested in learning more about the Chinese view of Bitcoin and the crypto landscape in China, *Bitcoin-Shape the Future* is right for you. It’s the first Chinese documentary on Bitcoin, and highlights companies like [Bitmain](https://www.bitmain.com/) and [Huobi](https://www.hbg.com/) that exist within China’s crypto space.<br/>

## **The Rise And Rise Of Bitcoin**

[*The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin*](https://bitcoindoc.com/) follows the story of David Mross, a computer programmer and avid Bitcoin enthusiast. David discovered Bitcoin in 2011, and he and his brother set out to create a documentary to help people understand what Bitcoin means for the world. Mross’s interviewees include [Erik Voorhees](https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees), [Charlie Shrem](https://twitter.com/CharlieShrem), and Mark Karpeles.

## **Bitcoin: The End of Money as We Know It**

[*Bitcoin: The End of Money as We Know It*](http://theendofmoneyasweknowit.com/)takes us back into history to trace the evolution of money to where we are today. The documentary walks us through ancient society, Wall Street and the current money system, and finally the vast potential of Bitcoin in the modern world. You’ll see some familiar faces like [Andreas Antonopolous](https://twitter.com/aantonop) and [Roger Ver](https://twitter.com/rogerkver) on camera, with film and TV producer [Naomi Brockwell](https://twitter.com/naomibrockwell) working behind the scenes.

*This film won the 2015 Special Jury Prize at the Amsterdam Film Festival and prizes at the* [*Anthem Film Festival*](https://twitter.com/AnthemFilmFest)*.*

## **Bitcoin: Beyond the Bubble**

If you’re looking for something short and sweet, watch [*Bitcoin: Beyond the Bubble*](https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/bitcoin-beyond-bubble/)*.* The documentary is only 35 minutes long, answers questions posed by many Bitcoin critics, and helps you understand the intricate world of cryptocurrencies.<br/>

## **Banking On Bitcoin**

Due to its Netflix status, [*Banking on Bitcoin*](https://www.netflix.com/title/80154500) may just be the most popular Bitcoin documentary in existence. It discusses the roots of the technology, it’s massive potential, and how it played out in its nascent years. You just might see a familiar face as you learn about some of the early players in the crypto space.<br/>

Crypto can sometimes seem infinitely deep, infinitely wide, and too quickly-evolving to keep pace with. I hope these documentaries will help you scratch the surface, and begin to understand the potential and importance of crypto and blockchain tech.<br/>
