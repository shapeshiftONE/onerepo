## New in CoinCap 2.0

Be sure to try out the updated Altfolio feature (a huge perk for anyone that wants to know the value of all of their cryptocurrencies — at once).

Now, you can monitor your portfolio performance without worrying about having private keys on your phone or linking exchange accounts. You can also input your individual buys and sells to view historical performance and cost basis by the asset.

Use the Watchlist feature to add the coins you’re particularly bullish on for a convenient way to see the data most relevant to you.
